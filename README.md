## Overview

**2VS Web Game** is a browser‑based competitive platform that brings together a variety of mini-games into one exciting tournament experience. Two players go head‑to‑head in different challenges—from classic arcade titles to puzzle and strategy games—to prove their skills. The integrated scoring system tracks performance across games, making it a comprehensive competitive arena. All you need is your browser—no installation required.

## Installation

No installation is necessary. Simply host the project files on any HTTP/HTTPS server (using Apache, GitHub Pages, or any static hosting service) and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

- **Game Objective:**  
  Compete against a friend by selecting from a menu of mini-games. Each game challenge contributes to an overall tournament score, and the ultimate goal is to outscore your opponent across all events.

- **How to Play:**  
  1. Launch the platform and choose a mini-game challenge from the main menu.
  2. Both players compete in the selected game (e.g., Tic Tac Toe, Pong, Hangman, etc.) using intuitive controls.
  3. Scores are updated in real‑time, and after each round, the next challenge begins.
  4. The final winner is decided based on the cumulative score across all mini-games.

- **Controls:**  
  Each mini-game uses simple, user-friendly controls (keyboard, mouse, or touch) as defined within its rules. The platform manages game transitions and overall score tracking automatically.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Provides the structural markup and semantic elements.
- **CSS3** – Powers the styling, layout, and smooth animations for a modern look.
- **JavaScript** – Implements the game logic, event handling, and overall tournament management.
- **Custom 2VS Engine** – Integrates multiple mini-games into one unified competitive platform.
- **Bootstrap 5** – Delivers responsive UI components and an intuitive interface.
